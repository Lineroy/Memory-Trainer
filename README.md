# Memory-Trainer

A program that will train your memory to memorize a huge number of numbers, letters and more! It provides for all possible situations where there may be errors caused by incorrect entry of values, etc. I ask you to! If you find any error, shortcomings, let me know! I will gladly fix it for better use; also write the options that can be added to this program - let it be the most "wrapped" and complex design options - we will implement it. Have a nice time using the program! :)

Version 1:
- Starts version with basic function for training memory.

Version 2:
- Adds a function that calculates the system language and sets it as the main one about program(You can change him in menu "Space");
- Opportunity change time to remember numbers and quanity symbols of number throught menu "Space";
- Small changes in design.
